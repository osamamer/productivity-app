Since they are both running within Docker containers, you can't use localhost.
localhost refers to the container of Grafana in the context of Grafana. But they are
on the same network. So what you can do is use hostname to access each container within
the network. So the way I did it was:
URL: postgres:5432
TSl or whatever: disable
user and pass: postgres
