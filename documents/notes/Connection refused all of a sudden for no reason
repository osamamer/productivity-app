Solution: DatabaseDriver has nothing to do with it. Change the ports back to 5432 in the Docker Compose (5432:5432)
and in the application spring properties file. Postgres is right not localhost.
And for some fucking reason when you try to change the port it never fucking listens. Even though it was working
on 5433 for a little bit but then it just decided to stop of its own accord. Sigh.
