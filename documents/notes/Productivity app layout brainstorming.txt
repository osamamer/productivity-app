Ideas for the new layout of the productivity app?
Elements of the page:
1. List of today's tasks.
2. Day information.
3. Highlighted task.
4. 


THREE MAJOR SECTIONS:
ONE: TASKS
TWO: HIGHLIGHTS
THREE: DAYS

ONE: 
today's tasks, and other tasks
TWO:
The highest priority task, whatever task you choose to highlight, and a third thing
THREE: 
Current day info, small calender

Make everything a nice little box with rounded corners

NO accent color :( because I need a neutral background to employ other colors for priority purposes and other fun shit.
